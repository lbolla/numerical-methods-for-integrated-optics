\section*{What do I mean with ``Mode Finders''}
One of the most powerful approches to study optical systems is the
eigenmode decomposition: the electromagnetic propagation is expressed
as a set of definite-frequency time-harmonic modes. In the absence of
nonlinear effects, all the optical phenomena can be descibed as a
superimposition of these modes.
